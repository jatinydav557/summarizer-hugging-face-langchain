# 📰 Website Content Summarizer using LangChain + Hugging Face 🤖

This is a **lightweight Streamlit web app** that extracts and summarizes any public website’s content using **LangChain**, the **Hugging Face Inference API**, and **Mistral-7B**.

## ✨ Project Impact

In a world overflowing with information, this tool helps users **save time** by turning long-form website content into concise summaries — perfect for students, researchers, and professionals.

> "This is one of the most **practical AI utilities** I’ve built — it's simple, fast, and valuable."

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. Enter a public URL (like a blog post or news article)
2. The app scrapes its readable content using `UnstructuredURLLoader`
3. Sends it to the **Mistral-7B-Instruct** model via Hugging Face
4. Summarizes the text using `LangChain`'s summarize chain
5. Displays a clean, focused summary in seconds ⚡
